      <h2>NGO Donation Portal</h2>
      <p>
      NGO Donation Portal is an online donation platform dedicated to bringing a positive change in society.
       It’s a platform to bring together those who want to give and those who are committed to working in the social sector.
      This portal enlists NGOs operating in India and provide them with a platform to showcase their work and reach out to donors. 
      The aim of this portal is to bring transparency and professional standards in the nonprofit sector.
       We focus on few NGOs who have excellent track record in implementing social projects and enlist them after rigorous screening of their projects, financials and governance.
        We  make every effort to give you the best possible options for your donations so that each rupee is well spent on improving the lives of disadvantaged sections of the society.

      <h2>Need of  Portal</h2>
        <p>
        Donation to charity is not new to India.
        It has been in existence since ages in the Indian society where people used to give offerings to their local
        religious entities which in turn utilize the donations for upliftment of poor and needy in the society.
        Over a period, the role of social transformation has been taken up by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) or voluntary organizations with a focus on specific issues.
        Since the last few decades, NGOs have come a long way to play a very significant role in addressing the developmental gaps in the Indian society.
        With the changing socio—economic trends and widening of income gaps, there were was a questionable rise in the number of voluntary organizations without
        understanding the local context and often many of them ended up serving a single need diluting the overall availability of the funds. 
        Coupled with a lack of accountability and strict regulatory control, many organizations started to misuse/ overuse funds while others languished without funds.
        Consequently, effectiveness of project implementation suffered and this has started to undermine the credibility of NGOs as a whole.

        <h2> Staffing</h2>
        <p>
         Some NGOs rely on paid staff; others are based on volunteers.
         Although many NGOs use international staff in developing countries, others rely on local employees or volunteers.
         Foreign staff may satisfy a donor who wants to see the supported project managed by a person from an industrialized country. 
        The expertise of these employees (or volunteers) may be counterbalanced by several factors: the cost of foreigners is typically higher, 
        they have no grassroots connections in the country, and local expertise may be undervalued.
        </p>
        <h2>Funding</h2>
        <p>
        NGOs are usually funded by donations, but some avoid formal funding and are run by volunteers. NGOs may have charitable status, or may be tax-exempt in recognition of their social purposes.
         Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. Since the end of World War II, NGOs have had an increased role in international development,
        particularly in the fields of humanitarian assistance and poverty alleviation.Funding sources include membership dues, the sale of goods and services, 
        grants from international institutions or national governments, and private donations.
         Although the term "non-governmental organization" implies independence from governments, many NGOs depend on government funding;
         one-fourth of Oxfam's US$162 million 1998 income was donated by the British government and the EU, and World Vision United States collected $55 million worth of goods in 1998 from the American government. 
         Several EU grants provide funds accessible to NGOs.Government funding of NGOs is controversial, since "the whole point of humanitarian intervention
          was precise that NGOs and civil society had both a right and an obligation to respond with acts of aid and solidarity to people in need or being subjected to repression or want by the forces that controlled them, whatever the governments concerned might think about the matter."[30] Some NGOs, such as Greenpeace, do not accept funding from governments or intergovernmental organizations.[
